  "text": "The Squad will be donating $10,000 to HUGS! This donation will significantly help families in Hawaii facing the financial and emotional hardships of caring for a seriously ill child. For 39 years, HUGS has served Hawaii children, ages birth to 21, diagnosed with life-threatening illnesses ranging from cancer, cardia issues, liver and kidney ailments, and chromosomal defects. The founding team was born and raised in the beautiful state of Hawaii and would love for our community to come together and support these challenged families. We also look forward to giving back to other charities and hosting charitable events in the future!"
